# Ambitions of olga ver 1.0 
* olga should be able to receive price & volume-data from Yahoo Finance of a single stock or several stocks from a list.
* olga should be able to calculate some [indicators](https://github.com/dasovm/olga/blob/master/indicators.md) from these data.
* olga should be able to store data to .csv files.
* based on the historical indicators, olga should be able to give a recommendation if a stock is worth buying (or staying long), selling or stay away.
* olga should be able to store all recommendations with its result for easier evaluation (maybe in a GUI?).

Note that no focus should be given on retrieving real-time data or put orders on the market. Focus should be given on finding a working algorithm with relevant indicators.
